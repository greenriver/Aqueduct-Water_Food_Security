            in coastal waters. The CEP indicator is a useful metric
            to map where anthropogenic activities produce enough
            point-source and nonpoint-source pollution to potentially
            degrade the environment. When N and P are discharged
            in excess over Si with respect to diatoms, a major type
            of algae, undesirable algal species often develop. The
            stimulation of algae leading to large blooms may in turn
            result in eutrophication and hypoxia (excessive biological
            growth and decomposition that reduces oxygen available
            to other organisms). It is therefore possible to assess the
            potential for coastal eutrophication from a river’s N, P,
            and Si loading. Higher values indicate higher levels
            of excess nutrients with respect to silica, creating more favorable conditions for harmful algal
            growth and eutrophication in coastal waters
            downstream.</td>
